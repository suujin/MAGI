##TEXT
The E17K mutation results in an amino acid change at position 17 in AKT1, from a glutamic acid (E) to a lysine (K). This mutation occurs within the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of AKT1 (Fig. 2) and results in activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. In vitro studies suggest that the AKT1 E17K mutation is less sensitive than wild-type AKT1 to inhibition by the experimental AKT inhibitor, VIII; a non-ATP competitive agent which requires a functional pleckstrin homology domain ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17611497 Carpten, 2007]). Other AKT inhibitors are in development.

* The role of AKT1 mutations for selecting/prioritizing anti-cancer treatment is uncertain at this time. However, it should be noted that AKT1 mutations are usually found in tumors wildtype for EGFR, ALK, and other driver mutations.
